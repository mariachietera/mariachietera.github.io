Why Agile Coaches Should Embrace Mindfulness

<div class=post-content><p>I am an Agile and <a href=https://neuromindfulnessinstitute.com/>NeuroMindfulness</a> Coach, and I love how these two aspects coexist in my way of showing up at work every day. More than profoundly influencing how we live our life, Mindfulness can be a powerful tool for our Agile Coaching mission.<br>
I am writing this article to provide a few <strong>science-based</strong> pieces of evidence why even the most skeptical of us should give it a shot.</p>
<p>Taking a step back to what it means to be a successful Agile Coach: as <a href=https://lyssaadkins.com/blog-1/2009/07/28/what-is-agile-coaching/>Lyssa Adkins</a> put it, it means to take on the dual flavor of <strong>coaching</strong> and <strong>mentoring</strong>. We are coaching to help someone reach for the next goal in their life, and, at the same time, sharing our ideas and experience guiding them to use agile well.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a coach, one of the primary challenges we face is <strong>presence</strong>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4Jke814PLU">&lsquo;Maintain presence&rsquo;</a> is also one of the updated core ICF competencies and it&rsquo;s described as being conscious and present with the client, employing a style that is open, flexible, grounded, and confident.¬†<br>
Neuroscientist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKdHB_0K3LQ">Amishi Jha</a>, describes Mindfulness as nothing else then a <strong>mind training to focus our attention</strong> in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, non judgementally, and with a quality of curiosity and kindness. This, as opposite of our autopilot default mode, where our mind seems designed to be most of the time.<br>
Practices like Meditation allow us to literally <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312586/>re-wire our neurological paths and thicken areas of the brain associated with attention</a>. Gaining presence is a fundamental prerequisite of <strong>active listening</strong>, a necessary step on our intention to establish <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>partner</strong> with the client.</p>
<hr>
<p>Jumping to the second flavour of Agile Coaching: acting as a <strong>mentor</strong>, we want to lead our team through <strong>change</strong> in order to <a href=https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/the-changing-role-of-the-agile-coach/>enhance agile maturity, foster cross-team alignment, and increase business value</a>.¬†<br>
Studies showed how Mindfulness improves <strong>resiliency</strong> and work engagement, while also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKdHB_0K3LQ">reducing overall <strong>stress</strong> levels</a>, thereby enhancing employee well-being and organisational performance. Once again, the key seems to be developing the ability to direct the mind at will: Dr. Amishia Jha explains how mastering awareness and meta-awareness‚Ää-‚Äänamely, being aware of where our awareness is at right now‚Ää- would unlock for us the capacity of deciding how much attention we want to associate to a specific fact or event, potentially a source of stress.<br>

<p>Although associating Mindfulness and Agile Coaching isn&rsquo;t still exactly mainstream, I hope I managed to show how the relationship between the two is actually backed up by science and proven to help our teams throughout our Agile journey.</p>
<p>You can start practicing Mindfulness in as little as a few minutes a day.<br>
Consistency is the key.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to start integrating some practices in your office for you and your colleagues, here there are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>apps for guided meditation like <a href=https://www.headspace.com/work>Headspace for Work</a> or <a href=https://www.meditationoasis.com/podcast>Meditation Oasis</a></li>
<li>online courses like <a href=https://jackkornfield.com/event/mindfulness-daily-work-ongoing-register-time/#>Mindfulness Daily @ Work</a>, a free 40-days online guided training by Jack Kornwell</li>
<li>organizations like <a href=https://siyli.org/programs/bring-siy-to-your-organization/>Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute</a>, holding different programs for both individuals and workplaces, or the <a href=https://neuromindfulnessinstitute.com/coaching-certification/>NeuroMindfulness Institute</a>, also offering different levels of coaching certifications.</li>
