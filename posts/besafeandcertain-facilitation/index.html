Why are we reactive or overly emotional sometimes? Why can we be resistant or hesitant about some ideas or people? In other words, these five domains are so important to you that your brain treats them like it treats survival issues.\nThe limbic system is an ancient part of our brain that has the job of keeping us safe. The limbic system is always on, and by pushing us away from threats or towards rewards, it unconsciously but powerfully influences our behaviour and our choices.\nTo understand how your limbic system is driving our clients and us in its efforts to keep us safe - Be SAFE \u0026 Certain model puts together the six social elements we move towards and away from. The acronym stands for BElonging, Status, Autonomy, Fairness, Expectations, and CERTAINty.\nThis model can help us understand the social brain well enough to navigate it skillfully. Keeping this in mind, we can design workshops that minimize threats response (avoid pain), maximize reward response (seek pleasure), and influence the experience of our participants for good.\nLet’s go through the six elements of the model one by one.\n###Belonging\nBelonging was necessary for the early man when survival depended on other people and safety in numbers. Today, in our business environment, it is still important; we strive to belong, fit in, and be liked and are afraid of being cast out. A sense of belonging will help a team work better together. Fear of being kicked out of the tribe will keep people from voicing an unpopular opinion, offering an innovative – but controversial - idea or sharing critical information, e.g., that a project is headed off track.\nHere are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:\nmake sure to start with the proper frame: ask one or more leaders to remember the why are we they here together, what they aim to achieve, why the work of today matters have ice breakers: especially if the people in the room don’t know each other yet, propose an activity that allows them to share a bit of their personal life to show up with some vulnerability. This will improve psychological safety and trust. ###Status\nKnowing one’s place in the tribe created stability and strengthened the tribe. When people feel relevant, unique and needed, they are more likely to be positive, contribute and recognise others’ contributions. When individuals have an unfilled need for status, they may become self-focused, critical of others or “ego-driven.” Today, in our business environment, we all feel better when roles are established, when we know how the (formal and informal) structures work, who the boss is and what our relationship with her is.\nHere are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:\nAt the beginning of the workshop, ask the attendees to introduce themself and name which expertise they are bringing into the room Make sure you show gratitude and validate each intervention ###Autonomy\nFinding new ways of doing things allowed tribes to survive, especially in challenging environments. In today’s world, we each want some sense of autonomy to be able to do things our way. People want to share their ideas, solve problems, and contribute to their tribe. Allowing people autonomy produces a reward response for them. It increases motivation and morale. For some, a strong need for autonomy will prohibit teamwork and collaboration. Micro-management and too many rules or restrictions create a threat response, resulting in lower morale and less engagement.\nHere are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:\nInvolve leaders or relevant stakeholders in the design of the workshop or invite them to provide feedback, and make sure the agenda or the activities don’t feel imposed on them Create an opportunity to co-create a workshop agreement at the beginning of the session: when do you prefer to have your breaks? How do you want me to help you in case of friction? How are we going to take decisions? How do you want me to behave in case someone violates our session agreement? Include some buffer with no activity planned for your participant to ask for questions or go deeper in any topic they want to spend more time on Be ready to toss what you prepared if in that moment it doesn’t serve your participants ###Fairness\nExperiencing unfairness (to self or others) creates a deep-seated emotional reaction and the desire for revenge. It is a strong emotion, and we can spend a lot of energy overcoming it when it happens. Fairness is an essential driver in today’s workplaces. People appreciate being treated fairly and are more likely to be generous in their contributions when a culture is fair.\nHere are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:\nIt’s crucial for you as a facilitator to remain an unbiased moderator As the workshop host, you should help balance speaking time and make sure everybody feels free to contribute to the conversation. ‘What are some important voices we haven’t heard from yet?’ create opportunities for people to open up and share their perception of fairness and empathize with each other ###Expectations\nCreating expectations helped our ancestors be hopeful and persevere from season to season and year to year. Expectations create motivation and inspiration. When expectations are not met, we experience disappointment which can be surprisingly painful and discouraging. Setting clear, motivating, and realistic expectations will help build trust when working with others.\nHere are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:\nMake clear in advance which kind of participation/preparation is required: send an email with all the requirements well ahead of time Make sure the participant are aware and aligned on the outcome expected out of the workshop Make sure to explain the workshop agenda in detail, when each topic will be touched on, and how. Explain activities or tasks in advance as details as possible. Help leaders to define realistic goals: it might be helpful to manage expectations by determining a minimum outcome to hit and consider everything else as a bonus to avoid disappointment among the participants ###Certainty: ability to predict the future\nA sense of certainty helps people relax and trust, and they can more easily focus on tasks if their basic needs are met. Some people will feel threatened by uncertainty and do anything to establish a sense of certainty, for example resisting the new ideas or people they’re exposed to.\nHere are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:\nmake sure the participants are clear on how the workshop fits the big picture and how it will impact them create opportunities for the participants to ask for clarifications to what is not clear and help them to define a strategy for tackling open questions after the session ends talk about the hardship of change: you can use the Tuckman curve as a tool to show how our brain is expected to tackle uncertainty and instability and normalize it limit novelty: reduce the number of new tools, formats or activities you propose in a workshop, especially if the audience isn’t used to working together Even with several unknowns, help them become aware of what is certain: What are we certain about? What can we do to raise our level our certainty?
